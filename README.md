# neural-net-using-numpy
An implementation of feed forward neural networks using only numpy. Batchnorm, regularisation methods, dropout, various activation and cost functions have been implemented. Optimisation algorithm used is SGD. 

For better utility, a feature for saving models and using it again later is also implemeneted. 

Written in python 3.6

### TO-DO
1. Add other optimization techniques like Adam, Adagrad, etc. 
2. Create visualisation functions (loss or accuracy vs epochs, etc.)
